<p> Zindagi means life.my life changed when i came to new zealand on the 4 of march 2016 and i started primary after 2 weeks which was fairburn primary never in my life i expected that i might come nz primary was fun i enjoyed the most of it but i skiped year 5 and went to 5 year to year 6 so it was my last year was pretty werid when i found out that but was worth it.</br> when i went to intermidate school 2017 didnt know things will change plus friends life started to get confusing since i came to nz, never knew friends change when we go to different school.</br> that year i started to know more about things.once after school i started  the photos i have used shows where im most happy being with huma kutie angel and kk i have known angel past 7 years we had up and downs last year 2022 we completely igonered each other for no reason, but never hated each other but pretended to hate each other.</br> this year 2023 we started talking because of rishants in Re class from that day we started to be friends as usual and we are always the loud one in dte class and always getting in trouble by the teacher for no reasons.</br> in class or outside we hit each other for no reason and swear aswell this kuite always helps me by giving me relationshp advice but never help me in class execpt dte.</br> kk is a lovely boy he knows i sit in the same place as him he always offs the computer because he is a nigga.</br> i also made another nickname for kk kuta kamina. He is funny, intelligent like a smart nigga, But he is to shy to talk to other girls, He plays soccor but he is to lazy to run after the ball, He stays in one spot until soccor ball come to him.</br>but thats not it when i started in 2019 Otahuhu college was better different of what i through it will be first day i made friends with most stupid kuitya girls anushika and mahek been friends with them for 1.5 years really regreted it but i learned my lesson so many things happened during that past years first year of our friendship went pretty well but when lockdown happened things got worse trust issues how we were behaving weiredly with eachother me and anushika started to have beef with each other because she was talking the guy i liked without me knowing we hardly talked even when the school started first day of school mahek only came to school and me we both talked but from that day me and anushika never talked second day was the last day of our friendship after that she dated ayshap who i liked the past 2 years he knew that but he never liked me i was okay with that at least we both talked something happened in 2021 around june between me and ayshap he really started to hate me but i really liked him we never talked sice that not even looked ta eachother that day i really felt dispointed why i never told him the truth but i was okay with it, its past now i dont wanna go back maybe things can get more worse if i did we both give each other side eye both we never talked., Today 2023 13/09 never through i would go back to where i came from the past the people when i already forgetted him (Ayshap).</br>ash started to work with me today 13/9 in middlemore kitchen i heard ayshap saying (hows work at middlemore to Ash (Ashraan) but i never knew that it true that he will work i freaked out when i saw him in the  manager and supervoiser office talking to him i was in my own world walking minding my own business until some kind of smell hit me of him i looked at him said ash he looked at me and smiled i waved at him then went to the staff room i seriouly couldnt believe it that he will actual going to work with me he didn't go school that day i was shaking that day with happiness in face but scaredness in my heart dont know what will happen later.</br> the superviser asked him which school he goes to he replied otahuhu college and told oh that one of the girl priya goes there too he called me in the office and introduced me to him and asked to to train him for fsa 11 i was yeah sure im fine with it, and if he is then yeah he was yeah im okay with it we had like 3 minutes left i had to lead the tray line that day i was here u can find the hairnet acha then lets we need to start the tray line i was here u can find all of the things here, ( i was damm like really im talking to him i cant believe this no i can this is unbelieveable what's happening mohammed abraal is talking me,. i dont know why that day i was emotional and really exicted but dying inside what will happen next i started to have a crush on him but i wasnt in love thank god i wasnt., as now school is coming to an end all my moments with the people i love will be memories things will change soon</p
